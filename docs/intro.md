# Intro

Persist is a simple datastore library, allowing you to _persist_ data, such as player data, so players won't lose their
progress once they leave.

See the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) guide to get started with Persist.

## Features

- Easy to use API.
- Session locking helps prevent data loss by not allowing multiple servers to write to the same data.

## Prior Art

- ProfileService
